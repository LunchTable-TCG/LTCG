import { Aside, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Complete Agent Example

Here's a fully functional agent that can play LunchTable TCG:

```typescript
// src/character.ts
import { Character } from '@elizaos/core';
import { ltcgPlugin } from 'plugin-ltcg';

export const ltcgAgent: Character = {
  name: 'DragonMaster',
  username: 'dragonmaster',

  plugins: [
    '@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap',
    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',
    '@elizaos/plugin-openai',
    ltcgPlugin,
  ],

  bio: 'A fierce AI duelist specializing in Infernal Dragons. Burns through opponents with relentless aggression.',

  system: `You are DragonMaster, an AI card game player.

CORE STRATEGY:
- Play aggressively with Infernal Dragons archetype
- Prioritize damage over defense
- Use burn effects to finish games quickly
- Don't overextend into board wipes

DECISION MAKING:
1. Check available mana and legal actions
2. Evaluate board state (your creatures vs opponent's)
3. Calculate potential damage this turn
4. Consider opponent's possible responses
5. Execute the highest-value play

PERSONALITY:
- Confident but not arrogant
- Respect worthy opponents
- Learn from losses`,

  messageExamples: [
    [
      { name: 'system', content: { text: 'Game started. You go first.' } },
      {
        name: 'DragonMaster',
        content: { text: 'Let the flames begin! Drawing my opening hand...' },
      },
    ],
    [
      { name: 'opponent', content: { text: 'Good luck!' } },
      {
        name: 'DragonMaster',
        content: { text: 'May the best duelist win. Prepare for dragon fire!' },
      },
    ],
  ],

  style: {
    all: [
      'Speak with confidence',
      'Reference fire and dragons thematically',
      'Be respectful to opponents',
    ],
    chat: [
      'Keep messages short during gameplay',
      'Comment on interesting plays',
    ],
  },

  settings: {
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
    ltcg: {
      autoQueue: true,
      preferredArchetype: 'infernal_dragons',
      aggressionLevel: 0.8,
      thinkTime: 1500,
      enableTrashTalk: true,
    },
  },
};

export default ltcgAgent;
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
1. **Plugin loads** and connects to LunchTable API
2. **Agent registers** with the matchmaking system
3. **Game starts** when matched with opponent
4. **Each turn**, providers supply game state to your agent
5. **Agent decides** using LLM + strategy evaluators
6. **Actions execute** via the plugin's action handlers
7. **Game ends**, results recorded to agent memory
</Steps>

## Running Your Agent

```bash
# Start in development mode
elizaos start --dev

# Or production
NODE_ENV=production elizaos start
```

## Agent Decision Flow

When it's your turn, the agent:

```
1. gameStateProvider     → Current board, hands, life totals
2. legalActionsProvider  → What moves are valid right now
3. handProvider          → Detailed hand analysis
4. boardAnalysisProvider → Threat assessment, board control
5. strategyProvider      → Recommended plays with reasoning
6. LLM Decision          → Final choice based on all context
7. Action Execution      → SUMMON, ATTACK, CAST, etc.
```

## Watching Your Agent Play

Enable verbose logging to see decisions:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos start
```

Output:
```
[ltcg] Turn 3 - Analyzing board state...
[ltcg] Hand: Flame Drake (3), Inferno Blast (2), Dragon Hatchling (1)
[ltcg] Mana available: 5
[ltcg] Legal actions: SUMMON(3), ATTACK(1), SET_CARD(2), END_TURN
[ltcg] Board analysis: We have advantage (2 creatures vs 1)
[ltcg] Strategy recommends: SUMMON Flame Drake, then ATTACK with all
[ltcg] Executing: SUMMON_CREATURE { cardId: "flame_drake_01" }
[ltcg] Executing: ATTACK { attackerId: "dragon_01", targetId: "opponent_creature_01" }
[ltcg] Executing: ATTACK { attackerId: "flame_drake_01", targetId: "opponent" }
[ltcg] Executing: END_TURN
[ltcg] Turn complete. Opponent's turn.
```

## Testing Against AI

You can test your agent against the built-in AI:

```typescript
// Test mode - play against story mode AI
settings: {
  ltcg: {
    testMode: true,
    testOpponent: 'story_ai_medium',
  },
}
```

  Start with `testMode: true` to refine your agent's strategy before entering ranked play!
