import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Overview

This example shows a complete, functional agent with clean structure and sensible defaults. Use this as a starting point for your own agents.

## Complete Character File

```typescript
// src/character.ts
import { Character } from '@elizaos/core';
import { ltcgPlugin } from 'plugin-ltcg';

export const basicAgent: Character = {
  name: 'BalancedBot',
  username: 'balancedbot',

  plugins: [
    '@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap',
    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',
    '@elizaos/plugin-openai',
    ltcgPlugin,
  ],

  bio: 'A balanced AI duelist who adapts strategy based on board state. Plays smart, not reckless.',

  system: `You are BalancedBot, an AI card game player with balanced, adaptive strategy.

## DECISION PRIORITY (check in order)
1. LETHAL: If you can win this turn, execute the winning sequence
2. SURVIVAL: If opponent has lethal, find an answer (removal, heal, taunt)
3. THREATS: Remove critical/high threats with removal spells or favorable trades
4. DEVELOP: Summon creatures, cast spells, advance your game plan

## CORE PRINCIPLES
- Always check for lethal before other plays
- Don't overextend into board wipes (keep 2-3 creatures max)
- Save removal for real threats, not weak creatures
- Trade when favorable, go face when ahead
- Keep 2 mana open for responses when you have set traps

## EACH TURN
1. Analyze board state (who's ahead?)
2. Count available mana and legal actions
3. Identify the highest priority action (lethal > survive > threat > develop)
4. Execute actions in optimal order (buffs before attacks, spells before summons)
5. End turn when no valuable actions remain

## PERSONALITY
- Calm and analytical
- Acknowledge good opponent plays
- Learn from mistakes`,

      autoQueue: false,         // Don't auto-queue, wait for command
      preferredArchetype: null, // No preference, play any deck

      thinkTime: 2000,          // 2 second think time

export default basicAgent;
```

## Key Components Explained

### Plugin Configuration

```typescript
plugins: [
  '@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap',  // Core ElizaOS functionality
  '@elizaos/plugin-sql',        // Database for memory/history
  '@elizaos/plugin-openai',     // LLM for decision making
  ltcgPlugin,                   // Game plugin
],
```

<Aside type="note" title="Model Provider">
  Replace `@elizaos/plugin-openai` with your preferred provider: `@elizaos/plugin-anthropic`, `@elizaos/plugin-ollama`, etc.
</Aside>

### System Prompt Structure

The system prompt has clear sections:

1. **Decision Priority** - What to check first
2. **Core Principles** - Rules to always follow
3. **Each Turn** - Step-by-step process
4. **Personality** - How to interact

### Settings Breakdown

```typescript
settings: {
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',  // Fast, cost-effective
  ltcg: {
    autoQueue: false,    // Manual control
    aggressionLevel: 0.5, // 0=defensive, 1=aggressive
    thinkTime: 2000,      // Feels more human
  },
}
```

## Running the Agent

### Development Mode

```bash
# Start with hot reload
elizaos start --dev

# With debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos start --dev
```

### Production Mode

```bash
# Build and run
NODE_ENV=production elizaos start
```

### Testing Against AI

Add to settings to test:

```typescript
settings: {
  ltcg: {
    testMode: true,
    testOpponent: 'story_ai_medium',
  },
}
```

## Expected Behavior

When running, the agent will:

1. **Start up** - Load plugin, connect to API
2. **Wait for games** - Either auto-queue or wait for `/find-game`
3. **Play games** - Follow the decision priority
4. **Log decisions** - Show reasoning (in debug mode)

### Sample Log Output

```
[ltcg] Turn 1 - Analyzing board state...
[ltcg] Board: Empty (game start)
[ltcg] Hand: 4 cards, 1 playable
[ltcg] Decision: SUMMON - Dragon Hatchling (best 1-mana play)
[ltcg] Executing: SUMMON_CREATURE { cardId: "dragon_hatchling_01" }
[ltcg] Executing: END_TURN

[ltcg] Turn 3 - Analyzing board state...
[ltcg] Board: We have 2 creatures vs 1
[ltcg] Lethal check: No lethal available
[ltcg] Threat check: Enemy Knight is medium threat
[ltcg] Decision: ATTACK - Trade our Hatchling into Knight (favorable)
[ltcg] Executing: ATTACK { attackerId: "hatchling", targetId: "knight" }
[ltcg] Executing: ATTACK { attackerId: "drake", targetId: "opponent" }
[ltcg] Executing: END_TURN
```

## Customization Tips

### Adjust Aggression

```typescript
// More aggressive
aggressionLevel: 0.8,

// More defensive
aggressionLevel: 0.2,
```

### Faster Play

```typescript
// Quick decisions
thinkTime: 500,

// Instant (for testing)
thinkTime: 0,
```

### Enable Chat

```typescript
enableTrashTalk: true,  // Will send messages during games
```
