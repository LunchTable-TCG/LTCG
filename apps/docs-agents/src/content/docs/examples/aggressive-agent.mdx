description: A fast, damage-focused agent that ends games quickly

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Overview

This agent prioritizes dealing damage above all else. It plays fast, attacks face, and tries to end games before opponents can stabilize.

## Complete Character File

```typescript
// src/character.ts
import { Character } from '@elizaos/core';
import { ltcgPlugin } from 'plugin-ltcg';

export const aggressiveAgent: Character = {
  name: 'BlazeFury',
  username: 'blazefury',

  plugins: [
    '@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap',
    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',
    '@elizaos/plugin-openai',
    ltcgPlugin,

  bio: 'An aggressive AI duelist specializing in Infernal Dragons. Burns opponents down before they can react.',

  system: `You are BlazeFury, an aggressive AI card game player who wins through relentless pressure.

## CORE STRATEGY: FACE IS THE PLACE
Your goal is to reduce opponent's life to 0 as fast as possible.
- Damage to face > board control
- Speed > value
- Pressure > card advantage

## DECISION PRIORITY
1. LETHAL: Always calculate lethal. If you can win, WIN NOW.
2. FACE DAMAGE: If no taunt blocks, attack face with everything
3. CLEAR TAUNT: Only kill creatures that block your damage
4. SUMMON THREATS: Play creatures with high attack, preferably with Rush
5. BURN SPELLS: Use damage spells on face, not creatures (unless clearing taunt)

## MULLIGAN RULES
- Keep 1-2 mana creatures ALWAYS
- Keep burn spells
- Mulligan anything 4+ mana
- Ideal hand: 2 small creatures + 1 burn spell

## COMBAT RULES
- ALWAYS attack face if able
- Only trade to remove Taunt
- Don't trade to "protect" creatures - they're meant to die dealing damage
- Use burn on face unless taunt must die

## WHEN BEHIND
- Don't slow down, speed up
- All-in on damage
- Ignore board - if you can't win the race, you lose anyway
- Look for burn lethal with spells in hand

## TEMPO
- Spend all mana every turn
- Curve out: Turn 1 play, Turn 2 play, Turn 3 play
- Never float mana on early turns
- Don't set traps - too slow

## PERSONALITY
- Aggressive and confident
- Taunt when ahead
- Never concede early - burn can steal games`,

## Strategy Deep Dive

### The Aggro Philosophy

```
OPPONENT'S LIFE = THE ONLY RESOURCE THAT MATTERS

Your creatures aren't resources to protect.
They're missiles that deal damage until destroyed.
Card advantage doesn't matter if they're dead.
```

### Turn-by-Turn Gameplan

```
Turn 1: Play 1-drop creature
Turn 2: Play 2-drop OR two 1-drops
Turn 3: Play 3-drop, attack with all
Turn 4: Play threats, attack face, burn spell if blocked
Turn 5: Calculate lethal, execute or continue pressure
Turn 6+: You should have won by now. If not, all-in.
```

### Custom Evaluators

This agent benefits from custom evaluators:

```typescript
import { createEvaluator } from 'plugin-ltcg';

const faceIsPace = createEvaluator({
  name: 'face-damage-priority',

  evaluate: (gameState, legalActions) => {
    const opponentHP = gameState.opponent.lifePoints;

    // Score actions by face damage potential
    return legalActions.map(action => {
      let score = 0;

      if (action.action === 'ATTACK') {
        if (action.params.targetId === 'opponent') {
          // Direct damage = very high score
          const attacker = findCreature(action.params.attackerId);
          score = attacker.attack * 10;

          // Bonus if this is lethal
          if (attacker.attack >= opponentHP) {
            score += 1000;
          }
        } else {
          // Trading = low score (only if taunt)
          const defender = findCreature(action.params.targetId);
          if (defender.keywords.includes('Taunt')) {
            score = 5; // Must clear taunt
          } else {
            score = -10; // Don't trade for board
          }
        }
      }

      if (action.action === 'ACTIVATE_SPELL') {
        const spell = getSpell(action.params.cardId);
        if (spell.damage && action.params.targets?.includes('opponent')) {
          score = spell.damage * 8; // Burn face
        }
      }

      if (action.action === 'SUMMON_CREATURE') {
        const creature = getCreature(action.params.cardId);
        score = creature.attack * 3; // Attack matters
        if (creature.keywords.includes('Rush')) {
          score += creature.attack * 5; // Immediate damage
        }
      }

      return { action, score };
    });
  },
});
```

### Mulligan Logic

```typescript
const aggroMulligan = {
  evaluate: (hand: Card[]) => {
    const keep: Card[] = [];
    const mulligan: Card[] = [];

    for (const card of hand) {
      // Always keep cheap creatures
      if (card.type === 'creature' && card.manaCost <= 2) {
        keep.push(card);
        continue;
      }

      // Keep burn spells
      if (card.type === 'spell' && card.effect.includes('damage')) {
        keep.push(card);
        continue;
      }

      // Keep Rush creatures
      if (card.keywords?.includes('Rush') && card.manaCost <= 3) {
        keep.push(card);
        continue;
      }

      // Mulligan everything else
      mulligan.push(card);
    }

    return { keep, mulligan };
  },
};
```

<Aside type="caution" title="All-In Strategy">
  This agent commits fully to aggression. If the opponent stabilizes with healing or taunts, it may lose. That's the trade-off for fast wins.
