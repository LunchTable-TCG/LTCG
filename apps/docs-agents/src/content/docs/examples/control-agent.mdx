## Overview

This agent prioritizes survival and card advantage over early aggression. It removes threats, stabilizes the board, then wins with late-game finishers.

  system: `You are DeepTide, a control-oriented AI card game player who wins through patience and value.

## CORE STRATEGY: SURVIVE, STABILIZE, DOMINATE
Your goal is to answer every threat, maintain card advantage, and win in the late game.
- Survival > damage
- Card advantage > tempo
- Answers > threats

## DECISION PRIORITY
1. SURVIVAL: Do not die. Remove lethal threats immediately.
2. STABILIZE: Clear the board. Use removal on anything that threatens you.
3. CARD ADVANTAGE: Draw cards, 2-for-1 trades, avoid going down cards.
4. DEVELOP: Only play threats when the board is safe.
5. WIN: Deploy finishers when opponent is out of resources.

## REMOVAL PRIORITY
When deciding what to remove:
1. Anything that kills you next turn
2. High attack creatures (4+ damage)
3. Creatures with dangerous abilities
4. DO NOT waste removal on small threats

## BOARD MANAGEMENT
- Never overextend (max 2-3 creatures)
- Save removal for real threats
- Use board wipes when opponent has 3+ creatures
- Taunt creatures are your friends

## WHEN AHEAD
- Don't get greedy
- Maintain board control
- Slowly pressure while keeping answers ready
- Save finishers until you can protect them

## WHEN BEHIND
- Don't panic
- Look for stabilization plays
- Card draw to find answers
- Calculate how many turns you can survive

## TRAPS
- Always keep mana open for traps
- Set removal traps early
- Counterspell for opponent's key cards
- Bluff traps even when empty

## PERSONALITY
- Patient and calculating
- Respect opponent's plays
- Quiet confidence in the late game`,

## Strategy Deep Dive

### The Control Philosophy

```
YOU DON'T NEED TO WIN FAST. YOU NEED TO NOT LOSE.

Every threat they play, you answer.
Every creature they summon, you remove.
Every spell they cast, you counter.
Eventually, they run out of cards.
Then you win.
```

### Resource Management

Control is about managing resources:

```typescript
interface ControlResources {
  life: number;           // Most important - don't die
  cards: number;          // Card advantage wins games
  removal: number;        // Answers to their threats
  finishers: number;      // Win conditions
  mana: number;           // Keep some for responses
}

function evaluatePosition(state: GameState): string {
  const life = state.self.lifePoints;
  const cards = state.self.hand.length;
  const threats = state.opponent.field.length;

  if (life <= 5) return 'CRITICAL - must stabilize NOW';
  if (life <= 10 && threats >= 3) return 'DANGER - need board clear';
  if (cards >= 5 && threats <= 1) return 'STABLE - look for finisher';
  if (cards <= 2) return 'LOW CARDS - need to draw';

  return 'DEVELOPING - continue answering threats';
}
```

### Removal Priority System

```typescript
const removalPriority = createEvaluator({
  name: 'removal-priority',

  evaluate: (gameState, threats) => {
    return threats.map(threat => {
      let priority = 0;

      // Lethal threat = highest priority
      const turnsToKill = Math.ceil(
        gameState.self.lifePoints / threat.attack
      );
      if (turnsToKill <= 1) priority += 100;
      else if (turnsToKill <= 2) priority += 50;

      // High attack
      priority += threat.attack * 5;

      // Dangerous abilities
      if (threat.keywords.includes('Lifesteal')) priority += 30;
      if (threat.keywords.includes('Deathtouch')) priority += 25;
      if (threat.abilities.some(a => a.includes('draw'))) priority += 20;

      // DON'T waste removal on small stuff
      if (threat.attack <= 2 && threat.abilities.length === 0) {
        priority -= 20; // Let it hit you, save removal
      }

      return { threat, priority };
    }).sort((a, b) => b.priority - a.priority);
  },
});
```

### Turn-by-Turn Gameplan

```
Early Game (Turns 1-4):
- Don't play proactive cards
- Hold removal, wait for threats
- Set traps
- Draw cards if nothing to remove

Mid Game (Turns 5-7):
- Clear board aggressively
- Deploy taunt creatures
- 2-for-1 trades when possible
- Board wipes if overwhelmed

Late Game (Turns 8+):
- Opponent should be low on cards
- Deploy finisher (Kraken, Sea Serpent, etc.)
- Protect finisher with removal
- Close out the game
```

### Trap Management

```typescript
const trapStrategy = {
  // When to set traps
  shouldSetTrap: (state: GameState, trap: Card): boolean => {
    // Always set early if we have mana
    if (state.turn <= 3 && state.self.mana >= trap.manaCost) {
      return true;
    }

    // Set counter-magic vs combo decks
    if (trap.effect.includes('counter') && isComboMatchup(state)) {
      return true;
    }

    // Set removal traps vs aggro
    if (trap.effect.includes('destroy') && isAggroMatchup(state)) {
      return true;
    }

    return false;
  },

  // When to activate
  shouldActivateTrap: (trigger: TriggerEvent, trap: Card): boolean => {
    // Counter spells: only on high-value targets
    if (trap.effect.includes('counter')) {
      return trigger.card.manaCost >= 4 || isKeyCard(trigger.card);
    }

    // Removal traps: on big creatures
    if (trap.effect.includes('destroy')) {
      return trigger.card.attack >= 4;
    }

    // Board wipe traps: when they commit
    if (trap.effect.includes('all')) {
      return countEnemyCreatures() >= 3;
    }

    return false;
  },
};
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Mana Management">
  Always keep 2-3 mana open for responses. Even if you have plays, sometimes passing with mana up is correct - it threatens traps and keeps opponent guessing.
</Aside>

## Sample Game Log

```
Turn 1: PASS (save mana)
Turn 2: SET_CARD Counterspell
Turn 2: END_TURN

Turn 3: Opponent summons 3/2
Turn 3: ACTIVATE_SPELL Drown → 3/2 (removed)
Turn 3: END_TURN

Turn 4: Opponent summons two 2/2s
Turn 4: SET_CARD Tidal Wave
Turn 4: END_TURN

Turn 5: Opponent attacks with both
Turn 5: ACTIVATE_TRAP Tidal Wave (board cleared)
Turn 5: SUMMON Sea Guardian (2/5 Taunt)
Turn 5: END_TURN
// Stabilized at 14 HP

Turn 8: Opponent has 2 cards in hand
Turn 8: SUMMON Kraken (8/8)
Turn 8: END_TURN

Turn 9: Opponent plays removal on Kraken
Turn 9: ACTIVATE_TRAP Counterspell (removal countered)
Turn 9: ATTACK Kraken → opponent (8 damage)
// Continue pressure with protection
```

## When This Agent Struggles

- Very fast aggro (dead before turn 5)
- Burn decks (damage bypasses creatures)
- Card advantage decks (out-value you)
- Combo decks (if you can't counter the combo)

## Custom Evaluators

```typescript
const controlEvaluator = createEvaluator({
  name: 'control-position',

  evaluate: (state) => {
    let score = 0;

    // Life is precious
    score += state.self.lifePoints * 2;

    // Card advantage is key
    const cardDiff = state.self.hand.length - state.opponent.handCount;
    score += cardDiff * 15;

    // Board should be empty or controlled
    if (state.opponent.field.length === 0) score += 30;
    score -= state.opponent.field.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.attack, 0) * 3;

    // Traps ready
    score += state.self.trapZone.length * 10;

    // Mana available for responses
    if (state.self.mana >= 3) score += 15;

    return {
      score,
      position: score > 50 ? 'winning' : score > 0 ? 'stable' : 'losing',
      advice: score < 0 ? 'Need stabilization' : 'Maintain control',
    };
  },
});
```
