title: Configuration Reference
description: Complete reference for all LunchTable TCG configuration options.
---

import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

LunchTable TCG is configured through a single `LTCGConfig` object that controls every aspect of your game -- from engine rules to economy, progression, competitive play, theming, and blockchain integration.

## Overview

Your configuration lives in `src/config/gameConfig.ts` and is structured as follows:

```typescript
const config: LTCGConfig = {
  game: { /* ... */ },
  economy: { /* ... */ },
  marketplace: { /* ... */ },
  progression: { /* ... */ },
  competitive: { /* ... */ },
  theme: { /* ... */ },
  blockchain: { /* ... */ },
};
```

Not all sections are required. Available sections depend on your platform tier (see [Tier differences](#tier-differences) below).

---

## `game`

Core game identity and engine rules.

### `game.name`

```typescript
game.name: string
```

Your game's display name. Shown in the UI, metadata, and anywhere the game is referenced.

### `game.engine`

The `EngineConfig` object controls the rules of gameplay:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `startingLP` | `number` | `8000` | Starting life points for each player. |
| `deckSize.min` | `number` | `40` | Minimum number of cards in a valid deck. |
| `deckSize.max` | `number` | `60` | Maximum number of cards in a valid deck. |
| `maxHandSize` | `number` | `7` | Maximum cards a player can hold at end of turn. Cards exceeding this are discarded. |
| `maxBoardSlots` | `number` | `3` | Number of stereotype (monster) zones on the board. |
| `maxSpellTrapSlots` | `number` | `3` | Number of spell/trap zones on the board. |
| `startingHandSize` | `number` | `5` | Number of cards drawn at the start of a game. |
| `breakdownThreshold` | `number` | `3` | Number of vice counters on a single card that triggers a breakdown check. |
| `maxBreakdownsToWin` | `number` | `3` | Number of breakdowns an opponent must suffer for a breakdown victory. |

```typescript
game: {
  name: "My Card Game",
  engine: {
    startingLP: 8000,
    deckSize: { min: 40, max: 60 },
    maxHandSize: 7,
    maxBoardSlots: 3,
    maxSpellTrapSlots: 3,
    startingHandSize: 5,
    breakdownThreshold: 3,
    maxBreakdownsToWin: 3,
  },
}
```

<Aside type="tip">
Smaller board slot counts (e.g., 3) create tighter, more strategic gameplay. Increase to 5 for a more traditional TCG feel with wider boards.

## `economy`

Controls in-game currency, pack opening, and wagering.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `startingGold` | `number` | `500` | Gold granted to new players. |
| `startingGems` | `number` | `100` | Premium currency granted to new players. |
| `rarityWeights` | `Record<string, number>` | See below | Probability weights for each rarity in pack openings. |
| `wagerWinnerPct` | `number` | `0.9` | Percentage of the wager pool awarded to the winner (remainder is platform fee). |
| `variantBaseRates` | `object` | See below | Base probability of pulling each card variant. |
| `pityThresholds` | `object` | See below | Guaranteed pull after N packs without a hit. |

### `economy.rarityWeights`

Probability weights used when opening packs. Higher values mean more frequent pulls. These are relative weights, not percentages.

```typescript
rarityWeights: {
  common: 60,
  uncommon: 25,
  rare: 10,
  epic: 4,
  legendary: 1,
}
```

### `economy.variantBaseRates`

Controls how often visual variants appear:

```typescript
variantBaseRates: {
  standard: 0.85,    // 85% chance of standard art
  foil: 0.10,        // 10% chance of foil treatment
  altArt: 0.04,      // 4% chance of alternate artwork
  fullArt: 0.01,     // 1% chance of full-art variant
}
```

### `economy.pityThresholds`

Guarantees that players receive high-rarity cards after a certain number of packs:

```typescript
pityThresholds: {
  epic: 150,         // Guaranteed epic within 150 packs
  legendary: 500,    // Guaranteed legendary within 500 packs
  fullArt: 1000,     // Guaranteed full-art within 1000 packs
}
```

```typescript
economy: {
  startingGold: 500,
  startingGems: 100,
  rarityWeights: {
    common: 60,
    uncommon: 25,
    rare: 10,
    epic: 4,
    legendary: 1,
  },
  wagerWinnerPct: 0.9,
  variantBaseRates: {
    standard: 0.85,
    foil: 0.10,
    altArt: 0.04,
    fullArt: 0.01,
  },
  pityThresholds: {

    legendary: 500,
    fullArt: 1000,
  },
}
```

---

## `marketplace`

Configures the player-to-player card marketplace.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `platformFeePercent` | `number` | `0.05` | Platform fee taken from each sale (5% = `0.05`). |

```typescript
marketplace: {
  platformFeePercent: 0.05,
  minListingPrice: 10,
}
```

---

## `progression`

Controls player leveling and XP rewards.

### `progression.xp`

XP awarded for different match outcomes:

| `storyWin` | `number` | --- | XP for completing a story chapter. |
| `storyLoss` | `number` | --- | XP for failing a story chapter. |

### `progression.levelCurve`

```typescript
progression.levelCurve: "linear" | "exponential"
```

Determines how XP requirements scale between levels:

- **`linear`** -- Each level requires the same additional XP. Consistent progression pace.
- **`exponential`** -- Higher levels require progressively more XP. Early levels are fast, later levels are grindy.

```typescript
progression: {
  xp: {
    rankedWin: 100,
    rankedLoss: 30,
    casualWin: 50,
    casualLoss: 15,
    storyWin: 75,
    storyLoss: 20,
  },
  levelCurve: "exponential",
}
```

---

## `competitive`

Ranked play, ELO ratings, and rank thresholds.

### `competitive.elo`

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `defaultRating` | `number` | `1000` | Starting ELO rating for new players. |
| `kFactor` | `number` | `32` | How much each match affects rating. Higher values = more volatile rankings. |

### `competitive.rankThresholds`

Maps rank names to minimum ELO values:

```typescript
competitive: {
  elo: {
    defaultRating: 1000,
    kFactor: 32,
  },
  rankThresholds: {
    Bronze: 0,
    Silver: 1200,
    Gold: 1400,
    Platinum: 1600,
    Diamond: 1800,
    Master: 2000,
    Legend: 2200,
  },
}
```

<Aside>
Players are placed into the highest rank whose threshold they meet. A player with 1500 ELO would be Gold rank.
</Aside>

## `theme`

Visual branding for your game.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `brand` | `string` | Brand name displayed in UI chrome, emails, and metadata. |
