This guide walks you through creating, configuring, and launching your own trading card game on the LunchTable TCG platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

| Requirement | Version | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Bun** | 1.3 or later | Package manager and runtime |
| **Node.js** | 20 or later | Build tooling compatibility |
| **Convex account** | --- | Real-time backend hosting |

You can verify your installations:

```bash
bun --version   # Should print 1.3.x or higher
node --version  # Should print v20.x or higher
```

<Aside type="tip">
If you do not have Bun installed, visit [bun.sh](https://bun.sh) and run the one-line installer.
</Aside>

## Create your project

<Steps>

1. **Scaffold a new game**

   ```bash
   bunx create-lunchtable-tcg my-game
   ```

   This creates a new directory `my-game/` with all the platform defaults pre-configured.

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd my-game
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start the Convex backend**

   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   bunx convex dev
   ```

   This starts the Convex development server and syncs your backend functions in real time. On first run, it will prompt you to log in and create a new Convex project.

4. **Start the frontend**

   In a separate terminal:

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

   Your game is now running at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Steps>

## Project structure

After scaffolding, your project has the following layout:

```
my-game/
├── convex/                  # Backend functions (Convex)
│   ├── schema.ts            # Database schema
│   ├── gameplay/            # Game engine, effects, combat
│   ├── economy/             # Gold, gems, packs, wagers
│   ├── auth/                # Authentication hooks
│   └── ...
├── src/
│   ├── cards/               # Your card definitions
│   │   └── starter-set.ts   # Default starter card set
│   ├── config/              # Game configuration
│   │   └── gameConfig.ts    # Core engine settings
│   └── app/                 # Frontend pages and components
├── packages/
│   ├── engine/              # Rules engine (card validation, combat, phases)
│   └── core/                # Shared types and utilities
├── .env.local               # Environment variables
└── package.json
```

### Key directories

- **`convex/`** -- Your backend. All game logic, matchmaking, economy, and progression run as Convex functions. You rarely need to modify these directly unless extending the platform.
- **`src/cards/`** -- Where you define your game's card sets. Each file exports an array of `CardDefinition` objects. See the [Card Authoring](/guides/card-authoring) guide.
- **`src/config/`** -- Game configuration including engine rules, economy settings, progression curves, and theme. See the [Configuration Reference](/reference/config).
- **`packages/engine/`** -- The pure rules engine. Handles card validation, summoning rules, combat resolution, spell/trap activation, and the vice/breakdown system.

## Environment variables

Your `.env.local` file needs two variables to connect to Convex:

```bash
# Convex deployment identifier (set automatically by `bunx convex dev`)
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:your-project-name

# Public Convex URL for the client
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project-name.convex.cloud
```

<Aside type="caution">
Never commit `.env.local` to version control. The scaffolding tool adds it to `.gitignore` by default.
</Aside>

These are set automatically when you run `bunx convex dev` for the first time. For production deployments, you will configure these through your hosting provider's environment variable settings.

## Next steps

You now have a running game with the default starter card set. From here:

- **[Card Authoring](/guides/card-authoring)** -- Design your own cards, effects, and archetypes.
- **[Configuration Reference](/reference/config)** -- Customize life points, deck sizes, economy, ranked play, and more.
- **[Deployment](/guides/deployment)** -- Ship your game to production with Convex and Vercel.
