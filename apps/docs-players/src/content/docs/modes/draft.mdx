import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Draft Overview

In Draft mode, you build a deck from scratch using randomly offered cards. It's a true test of adaptability and card evaluation.

## How It Works

1. **Open a pack** - See 5 random cards
2. **Pick one** - Add it to your draft pool
3. **Repeat** - Continue for 30 picks
4. **Build your deck** - Make a 40-card deck from your pool
5. **Battle** - Play until 3 losses or 12 wins

## Draft Tips

<Aside type="tip" title="BREAD Method">
  Prioritize picks in this order:
  - **B**ombs - Game-winning cards
  - **R**emoval - Creature destruction
  - **E**vasion - Hard-to-block creatures
  - **A**ggro - Efficient attackers
  - **D**uds - Filler cards
</Aside>

### Key Strategies

1. **Stay flexible** - Don't commit to an element too early
2. **Value removal highly** - It's scarce in draft
3. **Pick creatures over spells** - You need a board presence
4. **Mind your curve** - Draft low-cost cards

## Rewards

| Wins | Rewards |

| 0-2 | 1 pack |
| 3-5 | 2 packs |
| 6-8 | 3 packs + gold |
| 9-11 | 4 packs + gold |
