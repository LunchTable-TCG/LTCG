## Combat

### Attacking

1. **Declare attacker** - Tap (turn sideways) an untapped creature
2. **Declare target** - Attack opponent directly OR attack their creature
3. **Damage resolution**:
   - **Creature vs Creature**: Compare ATK values, lower ATK creature is destroyed
   - **Direct attack**: Deal ATK damage to opponent's Life Points

<Aside type="caution" title="Summoning Sickness">
  Creatures cannot attack the turn they are summoned!
</Aside>

### Combat Example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Scenario">
    Your **Fire Drake** (ATK 1500) attacks opponent's **Stone Golem** (ATK 1200).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">
    Stone Golem is destroyed because 1500 > 1200. Fire Drake survives.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Alternative">
    If you attacked directly instead, opponent would lose 1500 Life Points.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Mana System

Every turn you have **5 Mana** to spend:

| Card Type | Typical Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| Weak Creature | 1-2 Mana |
| Medium Creature | 3-4 Mana |
| Strong Creature | 5+ Mana |
| Spell Cards | 1-4 Mana |
| Trap Cards | 0 (set free, activation may cost) |

<Aside type="note">
  Unspent mana does **not** carry over to next turn!
</Aside>

## Card Abilities

Creatures can have special abilities:

- **On Summon** - Triggers when the creature enters play
- **On Attack** - Triggers when declaring an attack
- **On Destroy** - Triggers when sent to graveyard
- **Passive** - Always active while on field
- **Activated** - Pay a cost to use (tap, discard, mana)

- ✅ Opponent's Life Points reach 0
- ✅ Opponent cannot draw a card (deck out)
- ✅ Special win condition card effect

**You lose if:**
- ❌ Your Life Points reach 0
- ❌ You cannot draw when required
