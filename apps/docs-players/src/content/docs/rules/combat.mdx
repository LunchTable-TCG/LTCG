## Battle Phase Overview

The Battle Phase is where creatures clash and Life Points are lost. Understanding combat is crucial to victory.

## Declaring Attacks

<Steps>

1. **Select an attacker**

   Choose an untapped creature you control that doesn't have summoning sickness.

2. **Tap the attacker**

   Turn the creature sideways to indicate it has attacked this turn.

3. **Choose a target**

   - Attack an opponent's creature, OR
   - Attack the opponent directly (if they have no creatures or you have special abilities)

4. **Resolve combat**

   Compare ATK values and apply damage.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Important Rules">
  - Each creature can only attack **once per turn**
  - Tapped creatures **cannot** attack or use tap abilities
  - Creatures **untap** at the start of your turn
</Aside>

## Combat Resolution

### Creature vs Creature

When your creature attacks an enemy creature:

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Your ATK > Enemy ATK | Enemy creature destroyed |
| Your ATK < Enemy ATK | Your creature destroyed |
| Your ATK = Enemy ATK | Both creatures destroyed |

<Aside type="note">
  Elemental advantages modify damage! An Ember creature deals 1.5x damage to Nature.
</Aside>

### Direct Attack

When attacking the opponent directly:

1. Deal damage equal to your creature's ATK
2. Opponent loses that many Life Points
3. Your creature remains on the field

<Aside type="tip">
  Clearing the opponent's field opens them up to devastating direct attacks!
</Aside>

## Combat Tricks

### Trap Activation

During combat, players can activate trap cards:

- **Before damage:** Activate in response to attack declaration
- **During damage:** Some traps modify damage calculation
- **After damage:** Activate in response to combat result

### Quick-Play Spells

Quick-Play Spells can be cast during combat to:
- Boost your attacker's ATK
- Reduce the enemy's ATK
- Destroy a creature before damage
- Redirect the attack

## Advanced Combat

### Multiple Attackers

You can attack with multiple creatures in the same Battle Phase:

1. Declare first attacker and target
2. Resolve combat
3. Declare next attacker (if any)
4. Repeat until done attacking

<Aside type="tip" title="Attack Order Matters">
  Plan your attack order! Destroying a key defender first opens up direct attacks.
</Aside>

### Combat Abilities

Some creatures have abilities that trigger during combat:

| Ability | When It Triggers |
|---------|------------------|
| **On Attack** | When declaring as attacker |
| **On Block** | When chosen as defender |
| **First Strike** | Deals damage before normal combat |
| **Trample** | Excess damage goes to player |
| **Lifesteal** | Heal for damage dealt |

### Blocking (Optional Rule)

In some game modes, defenders can choose to block:

1. Attacker declares target (must be opponent)
2. Defender chooses a creature to block
3. Attacker's creature fights blocker instead

## Combat Example

Let's walk through a detailed combat scenario:

**Board State:**
- You: Fire Drake (ATK 1500), Flame Imp (ATK 800)
- Opponent: Stone Golem (ATK 1200), 15 Life Points

**Turn Sequence:**

1. **Attack 1:** Fire Drake attacks Stone Golem
   - 1500 vs 1200 → Stone Golem destroyed

2. **Attack 2:** Flame Imp attacks directly
   - Opponent has no creatures → Direct hit!
   - Opponent: 15 - 8 = 7 Life Points

**Result:** You destroyed a creature and dealt 8 damage!

## Combat Tips

<Aside type="tip" title="Pro Tips">
  1. **Trade up** - Use weaker creatures to destroy stronger ones via abilities/spells
  2. **Bait traps** - Attack with expendable creatures first to trigger enemy traps
  3. **Calculate damage** - Count your total damage before attacking to plan lethal
  4. **Element matchups** - Exploit weaknesses for 50% bonus damage
  5. **Save removal** - Don't waste removal spells; save them for key threats
</Aside>
