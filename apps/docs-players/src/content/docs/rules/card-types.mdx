## Overview

LunchTable TCG features three main card types, each serving a unique strategic purpose on the battlefield.

## Creatures

Creatures are the backbone of your army. They attack opponents and defend your Life Points.

### Creature Stats

| **Cost** | Mana required to summon |
| **ATK** | Attack power - damage dealt in combat |
| **HP** | Health points - damage creature can take |

### Summoning Creatures

1. Pay the mana cost during Main Phase
2. Place creature in an empty Creature Zone

### Creature Abilities

Creatures can have various ability types:
