## Top 10 Tips for New Players

### 1. Don't Overextend

<Aside type="tip">
  Keep cards in hand! If you play everything, one board wipe destroys your entire game.
</Aside>

Commit 2-3 creatures at a time. If they get destroyed, you have backup.

### 2. Set Traps Before Attacking

Always set trap cards before entering the Battle Phase. This:
- Protects you from counter-attacks
- Creates uncertainty for your opponent
- Gives you options if things go wrong

### 3. Learn the Mana Curve

Don't dump all your mana on turn 1. Plan ahead:
- **Turn 1:** 1-2 cost card
- **Turn 2:** 2-3 cost card or two 1-cost cards
- **Turn 3:** 3 cost card + trap

### 4. Read Cards Carefully

Card text is precise. Key words matter:
- "Target" - You choose
- "Random" - Chosen randomly
- "All" - Affects everything
- "When" - Triggers automatically
- "You may" - Optional effect

### 5. Track Life Points

Both yours AND your opponent's. Calculate:
- How much damage can you deal this turn?
- How many turns until you can win?
- Can your opponent kill you next turn?

<Aside type="caution">
  Don't race to 0 LP! Sometimes it's better to trade creatures than take face damage.
</Aside>

### 6. Understand Priority

When both players can act, the **active player** (whose turn it is) gets priority first. Use this to:
- Force reactions before playing key cards
- Bait out removal spells
- Stack abilities in your favor

### 7. Learn Element Matchups

Know the chart:
- 🔥 Ember beats 🌿 Nature
- ❄️ Frost beats 🔥 Ember
- 🌿 Nature beats ❄️ Frost
- ✨ Arcane beats 🌑 Void

Exploit weaknesses for 50% bonus damage!

### 8. Card Advantage Wins Games

"Card advantage" = having more cards than your opponent. Gain it by:
- Drawing extra cards
- Trading 1 card for 2+ enemy cards
- Using efficient removal

<Aside type="note">
  The player with more options usually wins in the long run.
</Aside>

### 9. Know When to Trade

Trading = your creature destroys an enemy creature and vice versa.

**Good trades:**
- Your weaker creature kills a stronger one
- You eliminate a key threat
- You protect your Life Points

**Bad trades:**
- Your key creature dies for a minor threat
- You lose board presence for no gain

### 10. Practice, Practice, Practice

There's no substitute for experience. Play games to:
- Learn common cards and combos
- Develop intuition for good plays
- Understand the meta
