## Deck Building Fundamentals

A well-built deck is the foundation of competitive play. Follow these guidelines to create consistent, powerful decks.

## Deck Requirements

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Minimum cards** | 40 cards |
| **Maximum cards** | 60 cards |
| **Copy limit** | Max 3 copies of any card |
| **Legendary limit** | Max 1 copy of Legendary cards |

<Aside type="tip">
  Stick to 40 cards for maximum consistency. More cards = less chance to draw your key cards.
</Aside>

## The Mana Curve

Your mana curve shows how many cards you have at each cost. A good curve ensures you can play cards every turn.

### Ideal Distribution (40-card deck)

| Cost | Count | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| 0-1 | 4-6 | Early game, traps |
| 2 | 8-10 | Core creatures, spells |
| 3 | 10-12 | Mid-game power |
| 4 | 6-8 | Strong effects |
| 5+ | 4-6 | Finishers |

<Aside type="caution">
  Avoid too many 5+ cost cards. You only have 5 mana per turn!
</Aside>

## Card Type Ratio

Balance your card types for a well-rounded deck:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Aggro">
    Fast, creature-focused decks:
    - **Creatures:** 24-28
    - **Spells:** 8-12
    - **Traps:** 4-6
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Control">
    Defensive, spell-heavy decks:
    - **Creatures:** 16-20
    - **Spells:** 12-16
    - **Traps:** 8-10
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Midrange">
    Balanced, flexible decks:
    - **Creatures:** 20-24
    - **Spells:** 10-12
    - **Traps:** 6-8
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Building Your First Deck

<Steps>

1. **Choose your element(s)**

   Start with 1-2 elements for consistency. Popular choices:
   - Mono-Ember (aggressive)
   - Frost/Arcane (control)
   - Nature/Neutral (sustain)

2. **Pick your win condition**

   How will you win? Examples:
   - Rush down with cheap creatures
   - Control the board then dominate late
   - Combo specific cards together

3. **Add your core cards**

   Include 3 copies of your most important cards. These should support your win condition.

4. **Fill the curve**

   Add cards to smooth out your mana curve. Ensure you can play something every turn.

5. **Add removal and utility**

   Include answers to common threats:
   - Creature removal (4-6 cards)
   - Spell negation (2-4 cards)
   - Card draw (4-6 cards)

6. **Test and refine**

   Play games and adjust. Replace underperforming cards.

</Steps>

## Common Mistakes

<Aside type="caution" title="Avoid These">
  1. **Too many high-cost cards** - You'll be stuck unable to play
  2. **No card draw** - You'll run out of options
  3. **No removal** - You can't answer threats
  4. **Too many elements** - Inconsistent synergies
  5. **Going over 40 cards** - Reduces consistency
</Aside>

## Synergy vs Power

When choosing cards, consider:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Raw Power** | How strong is the card on its own? |
| **Synergy** | Does it work well with other cards? |
| **Consistency** | How often can you use it effectively? |
| **Meta Relevance** | Does it counter popular strategies? |

<Aside type="tip">
  A mediocre card with great synergy often beats a powerful card that doesn't fit your strategy.
