## Beyond the Basics

Once you've mastered fundamentals, these advanced tactics will elevate your game.

## Tempo and Initiative

**Tempo** is the pace of the game. The player with tempo is:
- Making proactive plays
- Forcing reactions
- Dictating the board state

### Gaining Tempo

- Play efficient creatures early
- Remove threats while developing your board
- Force suboptimal responses from opponents

### Losing Tempo

<Aside type="caution">
  You lose tempo when:
  - Reacting instead of acting
  - Playing defensive cards without pressure
  - Missing mana curve plays
</Aside>

## Resource Management

### The Three Resources

| Resource | Description | How to Gain |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Cards** | Options in hand | Draw effects, efficient trades |
| **Mana** | What you can spend | Tempo plays, cost reduction |
| **Life** | Your cushion | Healing, defensive trades |

<Aside type="tip" title="Golden Rule">
  Life is a resource. Don't be afraid to take damage if it gains you cards or tempo.
</Aside>

## Reading Your Opponent

### Face-Down Cards

When your opponent sets a card:
- **What could it be?** Consider meta traps
- **When did they set it?** Early sets are often defensive
- **Do they leave mana open?** Suggests Quick-Play or activation cost

### Attack Patterns

- Hesitant attackers may have valuable creatures
- Aggressive attacks with weak creatures = setting up lethal
- Not attacking with lethal on board = holding something

## Bluffing

### The Empty Bluff

Setting no traps but acting like you have protection:
- Pause before opponent attacks
- Keep cards in hand visible
- React to their attacks with consideration

### The Loaded Bluff

Setting real traps but pretending they're unimportant:
- Set casually without much thought
- Don't protect your face-downs
- Let opponent feel confident

<Aside type="note">
  Bluffing is most effective against experienced players who think deeply about your actions.
</Aside>

## Optimal Sequencing

The order you play cards matters:

1. **Play draw effects first** - See more options before committing
2. **Set traps before creatures** - Protect investments
3. **Attack before second main** - Use combat info for decisions
4. **Play creatures main2 if possible** - Avoid instant-speed removal

### Sequencing Example

**Bad:**
1. Summon creature → 2. Attack → 3. Set trap

**Good:**
1. Set trap → 2. Attack → 3. Summon creature (if needed)

## Win Condition Protection

### Identifying Win Conditions

Your win condition cards are:
- Key combo pieces
- Finisher creatures
- Inevitable damage sources

### Protection Strategies

- Hold protection spells for key cards
- Bait removal with lesser threats
- Wait for opponent to tap out before playing

## The Clock

**The clock** = how many turns until someone wins.

### Calculating Your Clock

1. Total damage you can deal per turn
2. Divide opponent's Life Points by damage
3. That's your clock

### Racing

When both players have short clocks:
- Compare clocks (who wins first?)
- Consider if you can slow their clock
- Decide: race or interact?

<Aside type="tip">
  If your clock is faster, ignore their board and attack face. If theirs is faster, you must interact.
</Aside>

## Practice Drills

1. **Counting lethal** - Every turn, calculate if you have lethal
2. **Sequencing quiz** - Plan your turn order before executing
3. **Range analysis** - List all cards your opponent could have
4. **Clock calculation** - Track both clocks throughout the game
