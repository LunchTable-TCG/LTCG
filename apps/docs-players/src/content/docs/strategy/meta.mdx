## What is "The Meta"?

The **metagame** (meta) is the landscape of popular decks, strategies, and counter-strategies in competitive play.

Understanding the meta helps you:
- Build decks that compete effectively
- Make informed card choices
- Predict what opponents will play

## Current Meta Overview

<Aside type="note">
  The meta shifts with balance patches and new card releases. Check back regularly!

## Metagame Rock-Paper-Scissors

```
Aggro → beats → Control
Control → beats → Combo
Combo → beats → Aggro
Midrange → 50/50 → Everything
```

### What This Means

- If aggro is popular, play control
- If control is popular, play combo
- If combo is popular, play aggro
- If unsure, play midrange

## Tech Cards

**Tech cards** are specific answers to popular strategies:

| Meta Problem | Tech Solution |
|--------------|---------------|
| Too much aggro | Healing cards, board wipes |
| Too much control | Hand disruption, uncounterable threats |
| Too many creatures | Mass removal |
| Too many spells | Spell negation |

<Aside type="tip">
  Dedicate 4-6 slots in your deck to tech cards based on what you're facing.
</Aside>

## Reading the Meta

### Where to Find Meta Info

- Tournament results
- Leaderboard analysis
- Community discussions
- Your own match data

### Adapting Your Deck

1. **Track your losses** - What decks beat you?
2. **Identify patterns** - Is one archetype dominant?
3. **Add counters** - Include tech for common matchups
4. **Test changes** - Don't overtune for one matchup

## Meta Prediction

Advanced players predict meta shifts:

- **After patches** - Buffed cards see more play
- **After tournaments** - Winning decks get copied
- **Mid-season** - Counter-decks emerge
- **Late season** - Meta stabilizes

<Aside type="note">
  The best time to climb is right after a patch when the meta is unsettled.
