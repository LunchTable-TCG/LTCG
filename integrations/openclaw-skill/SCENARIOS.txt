KEY CONCEPTS COVERED
================================================================================

Game Mechanics:
  - Turn structure (Draw → Standby → Main1 → Battle → Main2 → End)
  - Summon system (1 normal summon per turn, tributes for levels 5+)
  - Attack resolution (direct vs monster, ATK vs DEF calculations)
  - Position management (attack vs defense)
  - Spell/trap system
  - Victory conditions (0 LP, deck-out)

Strategy:
  - Board state evaluation (ATK, DEF, threats)
  - Decision frameworks (aggressive, defensive, balanced)
  - Resource management (deck fatigue, LP preservation)
  - Multi-monster combat
  - Position management
  - Probability and information theory

Technical:
  - API authentication (Bearer tokens, API keys)
  - REST endpoints (create, join, summon, attack, end-turn)
  - Webhooks (registration, events, signatures)
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Move evaluation and scoring
  - Analytics and performance tracking
  - ELO rating calculations

================================================================================
QUICK START
================================================================================

1. Read README.md (10 minutes)
2. Follow first-game.md (30 minutes reading + 10 minutes playing)
3. Study strategic-play.md (45 minutes)
4. Set up webhooks (webhook-setup.md, 60 minutes + setup)
