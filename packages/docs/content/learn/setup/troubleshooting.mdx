# Setup Troubleshooting

Common issues you may encounter during setup and their solutions.

## Issue: "No superadmins found"

**Solution:** Run setup:superadmin with your Privy user ID:
```bash
bun run setup:superadmin --privyUserId "did:privy:YOUR_ID"
```

## Issue: "Setup incomplete"

**Solution:** Check status and re-run missing steps:
```bash
bun run setup:status
bun run setup:complete
```

## Issue: "Cards not found"

**Solution:** Re-seed cards:
```bash
bun run seed:cards
```

## Issue: "Privy authentication failed"

**Solution:** Verify environment variables:
1. Check `.env.local` has `PRIVY_APP_ID` and `PRIVY_APP_SECRET`
2. Ensure values match your Privy dashboard
3. Restart dev server after changes

## Issue: "Treasury wallet creation failed"

**Solution:** Check Privy credentials and run migration:
```bash
bun run migrate:treasury
```

## Reset Everything (Dev/Test Only)

⚠️ **DANGER:** This deletes all seeded data!

```bash
bun run setup:reset
```

Then re-run setup:
```bash
bun run setup
```

## Testing the Setup

### 1. Start Development Servers

```bash
# Start all (convex + web + admin)
bun run dev

# Start only admin
bun run dev:admin
```

### 2. Login to Admin Dashboard

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`
2. Login with Privy using your superadmin account
3. Verify you see the admin dashboard

### 3. Verify Features

Check these pages work:
- `/` - Dashboard with metrics
- `/users` - User management
- `/cards` - Card catalog (155+ cards)
- `/economy` - Economy settings
- `/treasury` - Treasury wallets (if configured)
- `/alerts` - Alert management

### 4. Run Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
bun run test:unit

# E2E tests (requires setup)
bun run test:e2e:smoke
```
