# Initial Setup

Complete guide for setting up LTCG from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Node.js/Bun** installed
2. **Convex account** with a project deployed
3. **Privy account** configured for authentication
4. **Solana RPC** endpoint (optional, for treasury features)
5. **Environment variables** configured (see `.env.example`)

## Quick Start (Automated)

### 1. Complete Setup (Production)

Run the complete automated setup for a fresh deployment:

```bash
bun run setup
```

This will:
- ✅ Create system user
- ✅ Seed default configurations
- ✅ Seed AI configurations
- ✅ Setup treasury policies
- ✅ Seed starter cards (155+ cards)
- ✅ Seed story chapters and stages
- ✅ Initialize progression system (quests & achievements)
- ✅ Setup alert channels and rules

**Time:** ~30-60 seconds

### 2. Create First Superadmin

After setup completes, create your first admin user:

```bash
# Get your Privy user ID from dashboard or after logging in
bun run setup:superadmin --privyUserId "did:privy:YOUR_USER_ID"
```

### 3. Verify Setup

Check that everything is configured correctly:

```bash
bun run setup:status
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "isSetupComplete": true,
  "needsSuperadmin": false,
  "details": {
    "systemUser": true,
    "configs": 15,
    "aiConfigs": 5,
    "treasuryPolicies": 3,
    "starterCards": 155,
    "storyChapters": 5,
    "storyStages": 50,
    "quests": 20,
    "achievements": 30,
    "alertChannels": 4,
    "alertRules": 6,
    "superadmins": 1,
    "admins": 1
  }
}
```

## Development Setup

### Quick Setup (Essential Data Only)

For rapid development iteration, use quick setup:

```bash
bun run setup:quick
```

This seeds only:
- System user
- Configs (system + AI)
- Starter cards

**Time:** ~5-10 seconds
